> by Richard I. Cook, MD 


### Notes
1. Complex systems are intrinsically hazardous systems
    - not preventable
    - must anticipate, try to defend and recover
2. Complext systems are heavily and successfully defended against failure
3. Catastrophe requires multiple failures - single point failures are not enough
4. Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them
5. Complex systems run in degraded mode
    - all complex systems are broken all the time
6. Catastrophe is always just around the corner
7. Post-accident attribution to a 'root cause' is fundamentally wrong
    - because there is never a single cause
8. Hindsigh biases post-accident assessments of human performance
    - We know _now_, so they should have known it _then_.
9. Human operators have dual roles: as producers & defenders against failure
    - Before: focus on production
    - After: why didn't you defend>
10. All practitioner actions are gambles
11. Actions at the sharp end resolve all ambiguity
12. Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems
13. Human expertise in complex systems is constantly changing
14. Change introduces new forms of failure
15. Views of 'cause' limit the effectiveness of defenses against future events
16. Safety is a characteristic of systems and not of their components
17. People continuously create safety
    - Complex systems work because people nudge them right
18. Failure free operations require experience with failure


### Notes from Talk at Velocity 2012: Richard Cook, "How Complex Systems Fail"
- Systems research results
    - the real-world often produces surprises
    - exestential threats occur
    - demand & op-tempo varies
    - _stuff_ don't work as _advertised_
    - novel conditions are common
    - lots of adapting and tailoring
    - unanticipated variety
    - continuous change of tech/people
    - coping with shallow and deep conflicts

- The normal world is _not_ well-behaved
- Even so, a lot operatioal settings achieve success.
- Because of or in spite of the above?
- Systems as imagined (static and deterministic) vs. systems as found (dynamic and stochastic)
- What are people doing in the 'as found' systems?
    1. Monitoring
    2. Responding
    3. Adapting
    4. Learning
- resilience:
    - we design for reliability
        * stiff boundaries, layers, formalisms
        * defence in depth
        * redundancy
        * interference protection
        * assurance
        * accountability
    - we want resilience
        * withstand trasients 
        * recover swiftly & smoothly from failures
        * prioritize to serve high level goals
        * recognize & respond to abnormal situations
        * adapt to change
- How do we design for resilience?
    - support for continuous maintenance; should be part of design
    - revealing controls to the operators
    - show the lift points
    - support mental simulation aka mental models
    - open objects/methods -- have insight into how things work
    - deep-six the don't touch me's
    - empower operator learning

- What's the resilience agenda?
 - Operations are competent to hold the keys to the systems we build
 - Make resilience engineering the first priority of design for next generation systems
 - Commit resources to discovering, understanding, and supporting resilience through the system lifecycle



## Systemantics Axioms
- Systems in general work poorly or not at all
- New systems generate new problems
- Systems operate by redistributing energy into different forms and into accumulations of different sizes
- Systems tend to grow, and as they grow, they encroach
- Complex systems exhibit unpredictable behavior
- Complex systems tend too oppose their own proper function
- Systems attract systems people
- The real world is whatever is reported to the system
